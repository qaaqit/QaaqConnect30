# QaaqConnect - Deployment Required for Mobile App Production URL

## Issue Identified
The production URL `https://mushypiyush-workspace.replit.app` is not working because the Replit app hasn't been deployed yet. The backend is currently only running in development mode.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Backend Running**: Development server on `http://localhost:5000`
- ✅ **API Endpoints Working**: All endpoints responding correctly locally
- ❌ **Production Deployment**: Not deployed to Replit's production environment
- ❌ **Production URL**: No live URL available for mobile app

## Solution: Deploy to Replit Production

### Step 1: Deploy the App
1. **Open Replit Deployments Panel**:
   - Click on "Tools" in left sidebar
   - Select "Deployments"
   - Click "Create Deployment"

2. **Configure Deployment**:
   - **Name**: `qaaqconnect` or any preferred name
   - **Type**: Autoscale (already configured in `.replit`)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Run Command**: `npm run start`

3. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy" button

### Step 2: Get Production URL
After deployment completes, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://your-deployment-name.replit.app
```

### Step 3: Update Mobile App Configuration
Replace the placeholder URL in these files:

**File: `mobile-app/src/utils/api.ts`**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = __DEV__ 
  ? 'http://localhost:5000' 
  : 'https://YOUR_ACTUAL_DEPLOYMENT_URL.replit.app';
```

**File: `mobile-app/src/config/api.ts`**
```typescript
const PROD_API_URL = 'https://YOUR_ACTUAL_DEPLOYMENT_URL.replit.app';
```

**File: `mobile-app/src/screens/MapScreen.tsx`**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://YOUR_ACTUAL_DEPLOYMENT_URL.replit.app';
```

## Alternative: Use Current Development URL for Testing

If you want to test the mobile app immediately using the current development server:

**Temporary Solution** (for testing only):
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = __DEV__ 
  ? 'http://localhost:5000' 
  : 'http://YOUR_REPLIT_WORKSPACE_IP:5000'; // Not recommended for production
```

## Recommended Production Deployment Process

1. **Deploy Backend First**: Get the production Replit URL
2. **Update Mobile Config**: Replace placeholder URLs with actual deployment URL
3. **Test API Endpoints**: Verify all endpoints work in production
4. **Build Mobile App**: Create production mobile app build
5. **Submit to Play Store**: Upload to Google Play Console

## Current Mobile App Configuration
The mobile app is temporarily configured with `https://qaaqconnect.replit.app` as a placeholder. This needs to be replaced with your actual deployment URL once the backend is deployed.

## Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Deploy backend to Replit production
- [ ] Get actual production URL
- [ ] Update mobile app API configuration
- [ ] Test all API endpoints in production
- [ ] Build mobile app with production URL
- [ ] Submit to Play Store

The mobile app code is complete and ready - it just needs the correct production API URL once the backend is deployed.
