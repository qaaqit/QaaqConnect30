- **Google Maps**: Interactive maps with location services
- **Dio**: HTTP client for API communication
- **Go Router**: Declarative routing
- **Secure Storage**: Token and credentials storage

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.10.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android SDK for Android development
- Xcode for iOS development (macOS only)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flutter-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Google Maps API**
   - Get a Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
   - For iOS, add the key to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`

4. **Configure API endpoint**
   - Update `baseUrl` in `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`
   - Default: `http://localhost:5000` (for local development)
   - Production: Update to your deployed backend URL

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Backend Integration

The app connects to the QaaqConnect backend server:

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/profile` - User profile data
- `GET /api/users/search` - User discovery and search
- `POST /api/users/location/device` - Location updates

### Authentication
