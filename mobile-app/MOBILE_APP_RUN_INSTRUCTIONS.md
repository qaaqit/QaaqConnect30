# Mobile App Run Instructions

## Current Issue
The mobile app cannot run directly because the dependencies are not installed in the `mobile-app` directory. The packager tool is restricted to installing packages in the root project, not subdirectories.

## Solutions to Run Mobile App

### Option 1: Manual Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to mobile app directory in a separate terminal
cd mobile-app

# Install dependencies with legacy peer deps flag to resolve conflicts
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the mobile app
npx expo start
```

### Option 2: Global Expo CLI Installation
```bash
# Install Expo CLI globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g @expo/cli

# Navigate to mobile app directory
cd mobile-app

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the app
expo start
```

### Option 3: Use Development Script
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x mobile-app/install-and-start.sh

# Run the installation and startup script
./mobile-app/install-and-start.sh
```

## Expected Output
When successfully running, you should see:
- Metro bundler starting
- QR code for testing on physical devices with Expo Go app
- Options to run on web (press 'w'), Android emulator (press 'a'), or iOS simulator (press 'i')

## Platform Testing Options

### Web Testing
- Press 'w' in the Expo CLI to open in web browser
- Mobile app will run in browser with limited mobile features

### Mobile Device Testing
- Install "Expo Go" app on your Android/iOS device
- Scan the QR code displayed in terminal
- App will load directly on your device for full testing

### Emulator Testing
- Android: Press 'a' (requires Android Studio and emulator setup)
- iOS: Press 'i' (requires Xcode and iOS simulator, macOS only)

## Build Configuration Status
- ✅ All essential assets created (icon.png, splash.png, adaptive-icon.png, favicon.png)
- ✅ app.json configured with proper red color scheme (#dc2626)
- ✅ eas.json ready for production builds
- ✅ TypeScript configuration complete
- ✅ All icon sizing issues fixed (numeric values only)
- ✅ AsyncStorage dependency issues resolved
- ✅ Babel configuration updated for Expo 50 compatibility

## Known Dependencies in package.json
```json
{
  "expo": "~50.0.21",
  "react-native": "0.73.6",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.23.1",
  "react-native-reanimated": "~3.6.2",
  "react-native-maps": "1.10.0",
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.60.5"
}
```

The mobile app is fully ready for development and testing once dependencies are installed manually.
